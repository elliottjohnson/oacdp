  <legend>Mirroring</legend>
  <p>Would you like to house a mirror locally on your computer or
     server?   A good method is with a utility
     called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>,
     which most UNIX's have installed.  For windows machines
     it can be installed
     via <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</a>. To mirror
     OACDP I've setup a rsync server that can be used as
     follows:</p>
  <pre class="cli">
    rsync -avz rsync://oacdp.org/oacdp /path/to/a/local/directory
  </pre>
  <p>I suggest running this on a regular basis such as a unix cronjob.</p>

  <legend>Building from source</legend>
  <p>
    This website's source is published on 
    <a href="http://github.com/elliottjohnson/oacdp" 
       target="_BLANK">github</a>.  Feel free to
    <a href="http://git-scm.com" target="_BLANK">clone</a> it via
    <tt>git clone git://github.com/elliottjohnson/oacdp.git</tt>
  </p>
  <p>
    The project uses <a href="http://webgen.rubyforge.org" target="_BLANK">
    webgen 0.5</a> to render out the final html, which coupled with the
    overlay creates the site.  The command to render out the site is
    <tt>webgen render</tt>.  This should be run in the root directory
    of the cloned repo.  Feel free to <a href="contact.html">email</a>
    if you have any questions about the process.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the root of the project directory you can find a README.md file
    with instructions on how to build and deploy your own copy of the
    oacdp.  You can use the <a href="contact.html">contact info</a> to
    request a copy of the image overlay, which provides all the source
    images used in the project.  I would post it directly online, but
    for such a large file the bandwidth usage from webcrawlers alone
    would be significant.  If there are enough requests for the
    overlay I'll setup a torrent.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you've made local changes that you think deserve to be added
    back into the project I'm <a href="contact.html">glad to accept</a>
    patches or pushes of your revisions.
