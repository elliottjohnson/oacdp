  <p>Would you like to house a mirror locally on your computer or
     server?   A good method is with a utility
     called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>,
     which most UNIX's have installed.  For windows machines
     it can be installed
     via <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</a>. To mirror
     OACDP I've setup a rsync server that can be used as
     follows:</p>
  <pre class="cli">
    rsync -avz rsync://oacdp.org/oacdp /path/to/a/local/directory
  </pre>
  <p>I suggest running this on a regular basis such as from a
     unix cron daemon.  If you'd like <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> 
     access to the
     OACDP project, <a href="contact.html">visit the contact page</a> and 
     drop me an email.
