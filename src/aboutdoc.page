  <p>Often while working on a VW, I have run into situations where
     I was not sure what was correct for my car.  This sometimes
     occurs while trying to locate a specific part that is missing
     on my vehicle.  Generally the first thing I do is pull out one
     of my catalogs -- Wolfsburg West and Rocky Mountain Motorworks
     are the best for this -- and find the category of the part I am
     missing.  Then find the year application.  Bingo, now I know
     what I am looking for.  This sometimes works, but sometimes it
     doesn't.  If they don't carry the part it won't be in their
     catalog.  Or, perhaps, you've taken something apart and left
     it somewhere, and now that you've come back to it you can't
     remember how the darn thing went together!  Maybe you're
     trying to find subtle differences between two parts, or
     comparing measurements to find out which one is the least
     worn.</p>
	
  <p>In short, sometimes you need a reference.  Unfortunately, the
     Bentley "Official Service Manuals" often fall short in this
     regard.  This problem is compounded by the fact that when you
     need a reference like this, you generally cannot find them.
     If you can find one, it'll probably be expensive (maybe on an
     auction site like eBay), there will probably be only one, and
     someone else will probably get it.  This scarcity does not get
     rid of the fact that you need the information.  At this point
     you might give up, pay someone else to fix it, or maybe handle
     it "blind" and do it the best you can without any information.
     None of these options is really that great, and the latter can
     ruin a rare part, vehicle, or (depending on circumstance)
     endanger those that use the vehicle or part that you have
     cobbled together.</p>

  <p>The goal of this project is to put these hard-to-find
     technical reference materials online, including parts
     reference manuals, specifications manuals, part rebuild
     specs/procedures, tools manuals, and etc.  I will be using a
     flatbed scanner to scan materials, saving them as JPG or PNG
     files, and uploading them to the internet.  The goal of this
     project is NOT to remove the market for these manuals to be
     republished! If an obsoleted manual is put back into print, it
     will be removed immediately from this site.  Materials still
     being printed, such as the Bentley workshop manuals for
     '63-'67 busses and the VWoA service manuals, will not be put
     online.  In addition, if you can pick up something that is on
     this site, by all means do so!  There is no good substitute
     for having a book at your side while working.
  </p>
	
  <p>I welcome donations of materials that I do not posess for the
     project. I will accept items from you both on a permanent
     basis and a "lending" basis. I will also consider purchasing
     materials from you if you are not willing to allow me to
     borrow them from you.  Scanning from borrowed materials takes
     top priority so that they can be returned as quickly as
     possible, however the time of processing may be considerable
     depending on how busy I am, email me to inquire how much free
     time I have to scan.  In any case, either donation, lending,
     or selling, please contact me via email.  Thank you!
