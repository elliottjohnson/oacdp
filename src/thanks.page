    Wow!  Who archived this stuff for us?
  </legend>

  <p>The following people have made meaningful contributions to
     the Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project, and are
     deserving of your gratitude.  Where possible these people are
     credited on the pages where their work appears, as well as on
     this page.  Creating this site was not a trivial task and has
     taken many collective hours of work, probably better measured
     in days.  The list below is in alphabetical order and believed
     to be complete (PLEASE let me know if otherwise).</p>
	  
  <p>This site is a result of cooperation across the United
     States of all the people below.  It was possible only through
     the trust and friendship of the internet VW community here in
     the USA and all over the world.  Documents were sent in good
     faith through the mail to be scanned and all were returned to
     their owners.  Many of the people involved have never met each
     other in real life.  To me (the coordinator) this is an
     amazing thing, people sent documentation sometimes worth
     hundreds of dollars across the nation without blinking an
     eye.</p>

  <p>On this page I didn't put people who did little things like
     "this link is broken".  But any and all help improving the
     site is welcomed, and I thank you! </p>
